## About the Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data collected for the purpose are usually not in a format suitable for applying algorithms. The objective of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data used in this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Files in the given Repository
* **TidyDataSet.txt:** This file contains the tidy dataset obtained after the analysis.
* **run_analysis.R:** This is an R script that downloads the dataset and performs the required analysis. End result is the above TidyDataSet.txt file.
* **CodeBook.md:** The CodeBook describes what were the steps involved in the analysis. It also contains information about different variables. 
* **README.md:** This is the file you are reading. It gives a brief introduction about the project and apprises the reader of various files in this repository.
