## About the Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data collected for the purpose are usually not in a format suitable for applying algorithms. The objective of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data used in this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Following is the link to the data used in the project:

## Project Requirements:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files in the given Repository
* **TidyDataSet.txt:** This file contains the tidy dataset obtained after the analysis.
* **run_analysis.R:** This is an R script that downloads the dataset and performs the required analysis. End result is the above TidyDataSet.txt file.
* **CodeBook.md:** The CodeBook describes the Raw Data, the Tidy Data and also contains information about different variables. 
* **README.md:** This is the file you are reading. It gives a brief introduction about the project and apprises the reader of various files in this repository. It also describes the analysis performed on the data.

## Analysis Done
Run the R Script `run_analysis.R` in RStudio. The R script would perform following analysis on the Raw Data to yield the Tidy Data:

1. Loads the required packages - `tidyr` and `dplyr` (It is assumed that these packages are installed in the R Studio.)
2. Downloads and unzips the file.
3. Reads the required data into R.
4. Replaces the numbers representing activity labels for each feature vector by the names of the activities. The `activity_labels.txt` provides the correspondence for replacing the numbers by names. The objective is to make the activity labels descriptive. This operation is performed for each dataset (test and train).
5. Prefixes the SubjectID (obtained from `subject_test.txt` and `subject_train.txt`) to activity name for each respective feature vector and prepends it to the respective dataset. This is to make grouping and calculating averages easier.
6. Gives descriptive names to each of the columns (variables). This is done by using variable names given in `features.txt`.
7. Merges the two datasets.
8. Subsets the desired dataset by obtaining a logical vector that stands TRUE for column names with words `mean` or `std` in it and for column name equal to `Activity_Name`.
9. Groups the obtained dataset by `Activity_Name`.
10. Obtains mean for each column grouped by `Activity_Name`.
11. Splits the `Activity_Name` back into `SubjectID` and `ActivityName`. This is essential to ensure that each column comprises of one variable only (definition of Tidy Data).
12. Sorts data first by `SubjectID` and then by `ActivityName`.
13. Write the dataframe into a separate text file as `TidyDataSet.txt`.
